# Children's Brain Tumor Foundation - Family 2 Family

The objective of this initiative is to streamline the entry and
management of contact information, provide a tool to easily search the
database of Mentees and Mentors for matching purposes, and provide the
means for Mentors/Mentees to access their contact information to make
updates as needed.
